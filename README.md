# hello-world
Greetings and Salutations.
My name is Gabriel, and I am an aspiring programmer.  I am still learning and exploring, so I am not sure where I want to end up with this.  I do know that I am enjoying what I am learning, and look forward to turning it into a career.
At this time, I am farily comfortable with the basics of Python, and have done some work in SQL as well.  I am currently working on developing a portfolio of my work, and refining what I know.
I have spent most of my adult life in the field of youth education.  I started off as a teacher, and then moved on to a group home for at risk youth.  I feel it is time to move on from this, but not to leave it behind.  I wish to bring what I have learned over the years forward with me into a new path with programming.  There have been many times in my past work experience where I have come across a program, and felt that it could be done better.
